They claim to be in contact with the Tonmo god of Gaara, being able to interpret his commands to the world. At some points in history, multiple Tonxaras existed at the same time. This wasn't as big of a deal as it would seem to be, since they usually only had power over their local region anyway. Tonxaras would pass religious laws to shape the new direction of the faith, or to stop religious movements they deemed heretical. The title of Tonxara was sometimes given up by the patron nation if they had lost too much face. Only the most prestigious and powerful nations could host a Tonxara."
