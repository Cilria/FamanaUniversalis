 FAMANA_REC_BOOKMARK:0 "§GRecommended Nations§W"
 FAMANA_REC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "In 212, the most of Famana is in a precarious situation. The Gomic Sea, the traditional heart of civilized society, is decaying rapidly following the disastrous Yomtanian Wars against the Empire of Moxon. New empires such as Ordica and Fashros are on the rise to threaten the weak and fragmented region. In the south, the Empire of Dorromas is currently at its peak, and is meddling in the isolationist House of Tomba. Throughout the world, many tribes are scattered, some of which will grow into great empires.\n\n§YHighlighted nations have focus trees; and the rest are generally fun or present interesting challenges.§!"
 FAMANA_CHAL_BOOKMARK:0 "§RChallenging Nations§W"
 FAMANA_CHAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Fancy a challenge? These nations are in difficult, albeit not impossible, positions at the start of the game. Should you try to survive and turn them into real powers, you may find great reward."
 FAMANA_TOMBA_BOOKMARK:0 "A House Divided"
 FAMANA_TOMBA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Following the fall of the Kingdom of Hantomba, and the establishment of Liblatomba as its new successor to hold the Tombasorship, the House has been in disarray. With foreign influence in the once isolationist state growing, and dangerous new ideas spreading, keeping the House united will be a significant challenge for the coming years."
 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK:0 "Fall of Moxon"
 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Once the world's greatest power, the Empire of Moxon was very shortlived. Its Yomtanian Armies ravaged the Gomic, but then mutinied after the discovery of a temple. This Temple, northeast of Maky, informed them of the existence of a second continent filled with more of their kind. In an attempt to kill the Yomtanians, the King of Maky set the temple alight, causing them to go berserk and obliterate the region, turning it into a series of post-apocalyptic states. As the traditional core of the region in Oppia, Jasua and Ga Xal decays, new powers such as Ordica and Fashros are on the rise. The story of the region is still very dynamic and volatile."
 FAMANA_QAMON_BOOKMARK:0 "Heirs of Qamon"
 FAMANA_QAMON_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The Dorroman Empire is at the peak of its strength, and exerts control over almost all of Qamon. However, there are still many independent kingdoms operating around the sea, and the remnants of the old Kingdom of Qanoyo in Avus fled to Tomba, where they claim to be its direct successors."
 FAMANA_GEOPYOPIA_BOOKMARK:0 "The Great East"
 FAMANA_GEOPYOPIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "In 212, the largest and most powerful nation is the Empire of Geopyopia, formed after a warlord united the region following a succession crisis which destroyed the first dynasty. However, the Geopyopians are passive and traditional, and will have to compete with the Fashrans. The establishment of the Fashran Tonxara by the Tonmo tribes in order to spread the true religion is driving the state towards war and slavery, and the young empire is seeking West for its next conquests."
 FAMANA_ESTAL_BOOKMARK:0 "Estali Wilderness"
 FAMANA_ESTAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Considered to be a new Frontier for expansion, West Estal is still currently mostly inhabited by tribes. These formed under the Yomtanian Empire of Hasia, which invaded and significantly depopulated the region. Tribes have now moved in to inhabit the region. The most powerful of these were the Nahallians, remnants of Ordican settlers, as well as their rival, now reduced to the minor nation of Alo Tramo. Additionally, the pagan Ordican religion has been banished to the wilderness by a growing Lathvy presence. The region will need to defend itself from invasions on all sides, from Ordica, Restema, Walara, Oppia - and maybe even a renewed Yomtanian menace."
 FAMANA_NARAVAM_BOOKMARK:0 "Northern Lights"
 FAMANA_NARAVAM_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Consisting of dry tundras and cold steppes, the northern regions of Estal are sparsely populated except for three civilisations. One is Naravam, located along the Western Coast. Currently, this society is mostly nomadic and focused on various bloody wars, but has the oppurtunity to grow into a great power in the future. The strongest nation, Rdumkatvar, has been made into a subject of Ordica. Gotzlica is located around a series of lakes, where the climate is temperate compared to the steppes south of them, inhabited by the Qubare horsemen. However, the Gotzlicans should also be wary of a sleeping menace up even further north..."
