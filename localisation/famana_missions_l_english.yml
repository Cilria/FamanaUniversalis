 #Vanoman Missions
 van_develop_montava_title:0 "Develop Montava"
 van_develop_montava_desc:0 "Montava is the heart of Vanoma. It is the center of governance, trade, culture and faith. Accordingly, we should turn it into the greatest city in the world, the pearl of our nation and the envy of our rivals."
 van_technological_advantage_title:0 "Technological Advantage"
 van_technological_advantage_desc:0 "Vanoma and technology go hand in hand. Ever since the establishment of the University of Montava, knowledge has always been highly valued. If we make additional technological strides, we may be able to gain a significant advantage over our barbarian neighbors."
 van_colonize_borlebin_title:0 "Settle the Eastern Plains"
 van_colonize_borlebin_desc:0 "To our east is a lightly settled grassland area, populated by uncivilized tribes. Colonizing it ourselves would bring us closer to the Aresians, allowing us to trade with them, or maybe engage in some less peaceful endeavors."





 #Kinvireli Missions
 kin_theory_of_helvania_title:0 "Theory of Helvania"
 kin_theory_of_helvania_desc:0 "The Theory of Helvania was invented centuries ago in Ancient Vaximor. After the collapse of the Oppian Empire, the merchants of Kinvirel founded the Republic of Kinvirel based on the democratic ideals of Helvania. It is vital that we preserve these values and do not succumb to autocracy like the rest of Jasua."
 kin_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"
 kin_stabilize_the_realm_desc:0 "Now that we have solidified the founding ideology of our republic, we need to stabilize the situation in the capital. Many competing factions seek to seize power in Kinvirel, which we cannot allow."
 kin_the_grand_helvania_title:0 "The Grand Helvania"
 kin_the_grand_helvania_desc:0 "Our republic is the greatest in all Famana! Monarchs all around the Gomic hate us, simply because we are so successful. With our growing state apparatus, we will be just as strong as our autocratic rivals."
 kin_the_lathvy_question_title:0 "The Lathvy Question"
 kin_the_lathvy_question_desc:0 "The question of the Lathvy faith has plagued Kinvirel for years. Many in the country choose follow this new religion, especially in the northern cities. While the faith is completely tolerated in Kinvirel and sometimes mixes with local pagan worship, we ought to make up our mind. Should we adopt this religion, or hold on to our old beliefs?"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_title:0 "The One True Faith"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_desc:0 "Our state has finally chosen to adopt a single religion. But the religious problems of Kinvirel are far from over, as many in the country are not fully commited to their faith. To secure religious unity in Kinvirel, we must practice it to its fullest extent."
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_title:0 "Jasuan Religious Unity"
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_desc:0 "Jasua has long been divided along religious lines. In the south, Oppians practiced their own faith. In the north, many converted to the pagan Bamali religion. In Kapolia, Lathvy reigned supreme. This religious division is no more! Our ruler has seen to it that every Jasuan worships the same gods."
 kin_end_the_dark_age_title:0 "End the Dark Age"
 kin_end_the_dark_age_desc:0 "For far too long, Jasua has been mired in poverty and division. Ever since the Oppio-Jasuan War, the cities and roads of Jasua, once the greatest in the world, have been neglected and are now in a truly deplorable state. The Dark Age of Jasua has gone on for long enough. We are now in a position to finally reunite Jasua under one state, bringing an end to the current state of affairs so that we may rebuild and reclaim our status as a Gomic great power."
 kin_expel_mahansha_title:0 "Expel Mahansha"
 kin_expel_mahansha_desc:0 "Mahansha is a pest for the entire Eastern Gomic. Their ships raid and pillage the coasts of Jasua and beyond indiscriminately. This cannot be allowed to continue, so Mahansha must be driven out of Jasua."
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_title:0 "Defeat Zoblotra"
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_desc:0 "Our conquest of Mahansha has shown that our army is capable of fighting back against the Oppians. With this in mind, it would seem foolish not to attack the weak Zoblotrans to our south."
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_title:0 "Gomic Coffee Monopoly"
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_desc:0 "Coffee has never been an important export of Kinvirel. Spices and paper have always overshadowed our small coffee plantations. But now that we have conquered parts of the Hoxoi Coast, it is becoming clear that we are in control of the entire Gomic's supply of these precious beans. Perhaps this should be taken advantage of."
 kin_pacify_bamal_title:0 "Pacify Bamal"
 kin_pacify_bamal_desc:0 "The Bamali people, once an ally of ours, have been integrated into our realm. We must secure our hold on the region before we expand further northward."
 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_title:0 "Reforging the Jasuan Empire"
 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_desc:0 "The time has come to restore the mighty Jasuan Empire. The new empire, having regained the former glory of the old, will soon come to overshadow its predecessor. As we expand along the shores of the Gomic, we will spread the noble ideals of Jasua. The new golden age of Jasua is upon us."
 kin_hinder_yabonia_title:0 "Hinder Yabonia"
 kin_hinder_yabonia_desc:0 "To our east lumbers the giant Kingdom of Yabonia. Stronger than our puny republic, yet severely overstretched, Yabonia may be difficult to defeat. But with a strong army and the help of allies, we may just be able to."
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_title:0 "Onward to Jimkalin"
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_desc:0 "Our victorious conquest of western Yabonia has greatly weakened our rival and brought us closer to their capital. With these new territories in hand, we have a real claim to the entirety of the Jasuan heartland."
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_title:0 "Neutralize Yabonia"
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_desc:0 "Yabonia will soon be all but destroyed. We have conquered most of their land, and what remains of their pathetic kingdom will soon be wiped out by our grand army. We are now the rulers of the Jasuan heartland, so it is time to take the rest of our rightful territory."
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_title:0 "Unification with Kapolia"
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_desc:0 "Kapolia. The final piece of Jasua, yet unclaimed by our rising republic. Whether through diplomacy or war, we will integrate it into our state."
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_title:0 "Pearl of Jasua"
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_desc:0 "Kinvirel, our capital and most important city, is the greatest city in Jasua and the historic capital. But if we expanded the city even more, Kinvirel could truly be a jewel of the eastern Gomic."
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_title:0 "Sponsor the Merchants"
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_desc:0 "Many of our merchants are struggling to compete with Maxan and Xalnish traders. To secure our hold on the eastern Gomic trade network, we should do everything we could to make their job as easy as possible."
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_title:0 "Eastern Gomic Trade"
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_desc:0 "As the major trading power in the eastern Gomic, we are making a lot of money. However, to truly dominate the trade routes, we need a large merchant fleet."
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_title:0 "Assert Control of Hartimatul"
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_desc:0 "Harmanul, our old trading colony, has always been very important. It is a vital outpost for our merchants, but one thing has always been preventing us from using it as a staging ground for invading the Maxan isles, that being the local Maxan population. To take full advantage of Hartimatul, we must expel the locals and re-settle it with Jasuans."

 #Pextoglazian Missions
 pex_obtain_aras_approval_title:0 "Obtain Ara's Blessing"
 pex_obtain_aras_approval_desc:0 "The state of Pextoglazia is based wholly on the lathvy religion. Without Ara's favor, we would have nothing! As it stands, the clergy are not happy with the situation, from which we can infer that Ara is also displeased. To restore the holiness of Pextoglazia, we must take action to ensure that we are following Ara's will."
 pex_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"
 pex_stabilize_the_realm_desc:0 "Despite the unifying faith, Pextoglazia is fundamentally a nation of many peoples. Pextans, Glazians, Walarans and Nevians all inhabit the same kingdom, and in recent years, ethnic tensions have threatened to fracture our increasingly volatile nation. To prevent the dissolution of Pextoglazia, we must crack down on all would-be rebellions. We have no choice but to ensure stability, lest we slide into anarchy and civil war."
 pex_defend_pextoglazia_title:0 "Defend Pextoglazia"
 pex_defend_pextoglazia_desc:0 "Our northern neighbors, the Ordicans, are eyeing our declining dominion with malicious intent. Ordica was once an ally of ours, but it is clear that this is no longer the case. To protect our borderlands, we must expand the army and build new fortifications."
 pex_reorganize_the_army_title:0 "Centralize the Nation"
 pex_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "Pextoglazia is a mess of royally appointed bishops, governors of questionable loyalty, and local clergymen and nobles with their own agendas. To have any chance of repelling an invading force, we have no choice but to rid ourselves of this centralized system at any cost. The king must be granted more power over the nation so that its full might may be wielded against its enemies."
 pex_subdue_the_clergy_title:0 "Subdue the Clergy"
 pex_subdue_the_clergy_desc:0 "The lathvy priests, bishops and scholars that make up the Pextoglazian clergy hold vast power over our country. The Religious Leader, who often gets to choose the next king, has a major say in what decisions are made. Ideally, the power of the clergy should be limited, as it is actively disrupting the ability of the government to react to the problems it faces. With bribes, land seizures and revokations of rights, it may be possible to lessen their power, but it will be costly."
 pex_ensure_diocese_loyalty_title:0 "Ensure Diocese Loyalty"
 pex_ensure_diocese_loyalty_desc:0 "Eastern Pextoglazia is ruled by a collection of state-appointed bishops who, while technically subsurvient to their king, are functionally independent. They serve as arms of the clergy, and their influence runs deep. We must ensure that they are loyal to the king, and the king only, or we risk having our own subjects turned against us by foreign powers."
 pex_prevent_collapse_title:0 "Prevent Collapse"
 pex_prevent_collapse_desc:0 "Having taken several harsh, time-consuming and expensive measures to reform, centralize and mobilize the country, it is now clear that Pextoglazia will survive. The collapse, foreseen by so many, will not come to pass. Pextoglazia will live on, stronger than ever, as the spiritual leader of the lathvy world. The once divided groups of the country now stand as one, despite their many differences."
 pex_sway_the_inner_circle_title:0 "Sway the Inner Circle"
 pex_sway_the_inner_circle_desc:0 "While Pextoglazia is safe for the moment, it will not last forever. The bishops of eastern Pextoglazia are still de facto independent fiefdoms, so we should not give their bishops any opportunities to doubt the legitimacy of the state. Additionally, it is not only the dioceses that have questionable loyalties, but also the local rulers of New Pexamol. The island has been a hotbed of political dissent for a long time, and has even developed its own local culture. We must crush the local institutions and wipe away any semblance of independence from Pomlen."
 pex_integrate_the_walarans_title:0 "Institute Direct Rule"
 pex_integrate_the_walarans_desc:0 "The bishops of Lomea, Hilemo and Tegaria have bent the knee, but the easternmost dioceses remain free from government oversight. To bring these wayward provinces into the fold, we must first dissolve the dioceses of central Pextoglazia. Only then can we force the outer dioceses to relinquish their power. As our generals consider offensives into Ordica and Laglon, we will need the territory of the dioceses as staging grounds."
 pex_the_northern_menace_title:0 "The Northern Menace"
 pex_the_northern_menace_desc:0 "The Ordic dragon is waking up. The Ordicans are considering an invasion of our lands, and we are aware of this. To eliminate this grave threat to our own existance, we have no choice but to go on the offensive. Creating a buffer between the Pextoglazian and Ordican heartlans is the only way for us to truly be safe."
 pex_defeat_ordica_title:0 "Defeat Ordica"
 pex_defeat_ordica_desc:0 "Ordica has been pushed back by our righteous invasion, yet they remain a powerful foe. Southern Ordica still threatens the safety of the Slapni Sea coastline, so we ought to seize it too. With the southern half of Ordica in our hands, they will cease to be a threat in the foreseeable future."
 pex_deal_with_laglon_title:0 "Deal With Laglon"
 pex_deal_with_laglon_desc:0 "Laglon, the former Oppian colony that straddles the Estali coastline to our southwest, is a very interesting strip of territory. With it, we will be able to encroach on mainland Oppia, enabling us to make better trade deals and perhaps even establish a colony. To take control of Laglon, we have to first rip out its most important region, Druviked and its surrounding towns."
 pex_holy_restema_title:0 "Holy Restema"
 pex_holy_restema_desc:0 "Laglon is ours! These lands, formerly pagan but now lathvy, will be handed over to a loyal Feniki government who will enforce our will on the locals.With the help of Holy Restema, we will be able to influence Oppia greatly."
 pex_revenge_on_oppia_title:0 "Revenge on Oppia"
 pex_revenge_on_oppia_desc:0 "The Oppians are nothing if not backstabbing snakes. We could never trust them in the past, so now that we are in a strong position and they are not it stands to reason that we should put an end to Oppia once and for all. They have wronged us time and again, without a care. Once, they stood together, but now they are fractured, and as much as this suits us, it could change. To prevent anything like the Burning of Moxon from happening again, it is our moral imperative to act. Ara calls for Oppia to be destroyed!"
 pex_into_emastalia_title:0 "Into Emastalia"
 pex_into_emastalia_desc:0 "The Emastalian coastline is inhabited by the descendants of Maxan settlers. By seizing the nearby trading city of Riximi, we will be able to launch further invasions, pushing east along the coast."
 pex_the_holy_coast_title:0 "The Holy Coast"
 pex_the_holy_coast_desc:0 "We have successfully taken control of Emastalia, integrating our brothers in faith into our great lathvy regime. This wealthy and highly strategic shoreline will grant us control of the northern Gomic, allowing further invasions into both the great city of Bohora and our old homeland of Pextum."
 pex_invade_western_ordica_title:0 "Invade West Ordica"
 pex_invade_western_ordica_desc:0 "With control over mainland Ordica, this grants us the opportunity to advance deeper into western Estal. West Ordica is a relatively wealthy region populated mostly by lathvyites. It is only appropriate that we should assert our control there."
 pex_reclaim_the_homeland_title:0 "Reclaim the Homeland"
 pex_reclaim_the_homeland_desc:0 "Pextum is once again ours! The Xalian invaders have been driven out of our ancient home, and it is now in the hands of its rightful rulers. The integration of this territory has facilitated a reconnection with our cousins across the sea, the descendants of those who could not flee the Morian invasions. Although they are now assimilated into Xalnish culture, we will learn to understand each other soon enough."
 pex_defy_syadon_title:0 "Defy Syadon"
 pex_defy_syadon_desc:0 "Syadon Noy and his Nafan armies have risen from what was once the lowly kingdom of Stroktur. He seeks to spread his heretical views and found an empire based on the ideals of the Eclipse movements. Clearly, he must be stopped, and we are the ones who will do have to do it. By conquering Bohora itself, we will put an end to the madness."
 pex_conquer_kapolia_title:0 "Conquer Kapolia"
 pex_conquer_kapolia_desc:0 "The conquest of Bohora has yielded great benefits. The degree of control we now have over the north Gomic is almost absolute. Yet, there is another interesting prospect nearby. Conquering the lathvy Jasuans of Kapolia would completely secure our dominance over the Gomic Sea, and firmly anchor us in Jasua."
 pex_champion_of_ara_title:0 "Champion of Ara"
 pex_champion_of_ara_desc:0 "We have bested our rivals to the north, and defeated Syadon in battle. We have combatted all forms of heresy and will continue to do so. We are truly the greatest champions of Ara!"
 pex_the_great_crusade_title:0 "The Great Crusade"
 pex_the_great_crusade_desc:0 "Having defeated the Oppians and secured our position as the one true leader of the lathvy faith, it is about time we did something about the heathen barbarians in our backyard. Following decidedly non-lathvy religions, these uncivilized peoples ought to be shown the light of Ara. It is up to them if it will be by will or by force."
 pex_the_lathvy_empire_title:0 "The Lathvy Empire"
 pex_the_lathvy_empire_desc:0 "We have united most of the lathvy world under one flag. As both the spiritual leader and ruler of most lathvyites, we practically control the entire religion. Thus, we might as well make it official. Declaring ourselves as the Lathvy Empire would give us enormous soft power over Estal and beyond. No one could dispute our status as the great empire we really are."
 pex_establish_the_maxan_diocese_title:0 "Establish the Maxan Diocese"
 pex_establish_the_maxan_diocese_desc:0 "Bohora is ours! As we now control all of Moxon's colonies, there are those in our court who suggest we should take it a step further, and launch an invasion of Moxon itself. With Moxon in our hands, we could enforce our beliefs on those who still follow the despicable and heretical Maxan School of Thought."
