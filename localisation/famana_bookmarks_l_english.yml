 FAMANA_REC_BOOKMARK:0 "§GRecommended Nations§W"
 FAMANA_REC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "In 212, most of Famana is in a precarious situation. The Gomic Sea, the traditional heart of civilized society, is decaying rapidly following the disastrous Yomtanian Wars against the Empire of Moxon. New empires such as Ordica and Fashros are on the rise to threaten the weak and fragmented region. In the south, the Empire of Dorromas is currently at its peak, and is meddling in the isolationist House of Tomba. Geopyopia has isolated themselves, and Hasmal is technologically stuck. Throughout the world, many tribes are scattered, some of which will grow into great empires.\n\n§YHighlighted nations have mission trees; the rest are generally fun or present interesting challenges.§!"
 FAMANA_CHAL_BOOKMARK:0 "§RChallenging Nations§W"
 FAMANA_CHAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Fancy a challenge? These nations are in difficult, albeit not impossible, positions at the start of the game. Should you try to survive and turn them into real powers, you may find great reward."
 FAMANA_TOMBA_BOOKMARK:0 "A House Divided"
 FAMANA_TOMBA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Following the fall of the Kingdom of Hantomba, and the establishment of Liblatomba as its new successor to hold the Tombasorship, the House has been in disarray. With foreign influence in the once isolationist state growing, and dangerous new ideas spreading, keeping the House united will be a significant challenge for the coming years.\n\n§RThis region is not fully supported and playing here is not recommended.§!"
 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK:0 "Fall of Moxon"
 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Once the world's greatest power, the Empire of Moxon was very shortlived. Its Yomtanian Armies ravaged the Gomic, but then mutinied after the discovery of a temple. This Temple, northeast of Maky, informed them of the existence of a second continent filled with more of their kind. In an attempt to kill the Yomtanians, the King of Maky set the temple alight, causing them to go berserk and obliterate the region, turning it into a series of post-apocalyptic states. As the traditional core of the region in Oppia, Jasua and Ga Xal decays, new powers such as Ordica and Fashros are on the rise. The story of the region is still very dynamic and volatile."
 FAMANA_QAMON_BOOKMARK:0 "Heirs of Qamon"
 FAMANA_QAMON_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The Dorroman Empire is at the peak of its strength, and exerts control over almost all of Qamon. However, there are still many independent kingdoms operating around the sea, and the remnants of the old Kingdom of Qanoyo in Avus fled to Tomba, where they claim to be its direct successors.\n\n§RThis region is not fully supported and playing here is not recommended.§!"
 FAMANA_GEOPYOPIA_BOOKMARK:0 "The Great East"
 FAMANA_GEOPYOPIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "In 212, the largest and most powerful nation is the Empire of Geopyopia, formed after a warlord united the region following a succession crisis which destroyed the first dynasty. However, the Geopyopians are passive and traditional, and will have to compete with the Fashrans. The establishment of the Fashran Tonxara by the Tonmo tribes in order to spread the true religion is driving the state towards war and slavery, and the young empire is seeking West for its next conquests.\n\n§RGeopyopia is not fully supported and playing it is not recommended.§!"
 FAMANA_ESTAL_BOOKMARK:0 "Estali Wilderness"
 FAMANA_ESTAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Considered to be a new Frontier for expansion, West Estal is still currently mostly inhabited by tribes. These formed under the Yomtanian Empire of Hasia, which invaded and significantly depopulated the region. Tribes have now moved in to inhabit the region. The most powerful of these were the Nahallians, remnants of Ordican settlers, as well as their rival, now reduced to the minor nation of Alo Tramo. Additionally, the pagan Ordican religion has been banished to the wilderness by a growing Lathvy presence. The region will need to defend itself from invasions on all sides, from Ordica, Restema, Walara, Oppia - and maybe even a renewed Yomtanian menace."
 FAMANA_NARAVAM_BOOKMARK:0 "Northern Lights"
 FAMANA_NARAVAM_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Consisting of dry tundras and cold steppes, the northern regions of Estal are sparsely populated except for three civilisations. One is Naravam, located along the Western Coast. Currently, this society is mostly nomadic and focused on various bloody wars, but has the oppurtunity to grow into a great power in the future. The strongest nation, Rdumkatvar, has been made into a subject of Ordica. Gotzlica is located around a series of lakes, where the climate is temperate compared to the steppes south of them, inhabited by nomadic horsemen. However, the Gotzlicans should also be wary of a sleeping menace up even further north..."

 string_start_tag_gomic:0 "The Gomic is a very diverse place in 212. The region has just come out of the disastrous Yomtanian Wars which took down the Empire of Moxon, a nation which used Yomtanian armies to attempt to conquer the Gomic.\n\nIn the South-West, the Oppians used to be the largest empire in the world. The Oppian Empire went from Laglon to Quanex, Elorak, Makykay, Kinvirel, Degladon and Jimalkin. In 212 however, many years have passed since the collapse of the overextended empire. Oppia itself is centered around the port city of Quanex, controlled by the Crown Kingdom. This is a state which claims to be the successor to the ancient empire, and has the Crown of Emintas, used to crown Oppian Emperors, as proof. Despite this, Quanex is a decaying city as other cities in better positions such as Umzat, Elorak, Nuti, Nejavil and Astom are growing rapidly. In particular, Ossor is the most powerful Oppian nation. This is a desert empire with a militaristic culture which can pose a threat to the old core in the fertile West. Additionally, during the years of the Oppian Empire, many settlers were exiled out east to now form the East Oppian culture, one confused as to their identity ever since the collapse of the empire, and stuck between the Jasuans and Xalians.\n\nMaky is the most destroyed nation in 212. The Empire of Maky was obliterated by the Yomtanian wars following an incident at the Kashroon Temple. It was always the traditional core of civilisation, but it has now been devastated into anarchic tribes. As the survivors try to rebuild, the region may be threatened by new religions, and external invasions.\n\nGa Xal is the richest region in the world in 212. It is split primarily between the four powers of Noka Mor, Ale Mea, Moshiria and Delkia. The Xalian religion has been fragmented for a long time now, with the four religions each choosing a different patron God out of their pantheon. This is with the exception of Morian, which believes in one God. Although Moria used to dominate Ga Xal, ever since the formation of the Neo-Xalnish Empire after Sixan's conquest of Xon, the Morians have been oppressed. In 212, the Neo-Xalnish Empire has however fractured due to the damage of the Yomtanian Wars, and its future is still up in the air.\n\nMoxon was formerly founded by Xalian settlers, however it has developed a different identity. It has always been a naval region, focusing on trade and diplomacy. The Maxans set out and colonised many areas, such as Stroktur and Emastalia. However, following the collapse of the Maxan Empire, the islands have found themselves divided and confused. The remnants of the Empire's Jingoistic ideology has remained as the Maxan school of Lathvy Thought. Emastalia is also slowly developing an independent culture as they expand north, while Stroktur struggles to keep its native Kachik population docile.\n\nJasua is arguably in the most precarious position in 212. Split between the three powers of Kapolia, Yabonia and Kinvirel, the region still grasps onto pagan beliefs even as Lathvy is expanding. The ancient Jasuan Empire shattered at the hands of the Oppian Empire, which built up much of the infrastructure of the region. Now, along with the Aresian civilisation in the north, and various other cultures around the Aresian gulf, the region is trying to build a new identity. They will however need to be wary of a hazy threat that is coming from the east...\n\nPextoglazia is the dominant power of the Gomic in 212. Their decisive victory in the Great Gomic War and the Yomtanian Wars have left them as the most prestigous nation. However, not all is as it seems in the nation. The region still remembers the disastrous Hasian occupation, when the Yomtanian horde awoke from its slumber to conquer Estal. This eventually led to the Lathvy religion, which dominates the Gomic, being founded. The Pextoglazian school is based around the High Priest of Pomlen, a position established by the Lathvy Prophet himself. The issue is that this religious influence has to share power with the Holy King in a complicated government system. Western Pextoglazia has been divided up into Dioceses controlled by the High Priest which have autonomy over the King, and the King himself is chosen by the High Priest. Tensions may reach a boiling point and tear the nation apart should they cross the line.\n\nFinally, Ordica is a rising empire in 212. It is a fairly new nation, and has dedicated itself to depaganising its part of the continent. This is worrying as Ordica comes into tension with their southern former ally of Pextoglazia, and as Ordica looks north and west for expansion."

 string_start_tag_fashros:0 "The Fashran Tonxara is a young nation, having only formed a few decades ago. Its expansion was halted in year 206 after the disastrous Battle of Poguram, which forced it to sign a peace treaty with Geopyopia. This lead to the abdication of the prior Crota'tam Yharinel and the succession of Astrazna, a young ruler emboldened by the many pretenders he defeated to claim the throne. Since then he has consolidated his control of the Ravsho tribes, and, under his rule, several new cites like Pizuk and Tyma have sprung up. However, his greatest plans are yet to unfold. He has sent scouting parties into the vast western grasslands to explore beyond the borders of Fashros. His eagerness for conquest and glory is boundless, but the Fashran Horde has hit a hard barrier in Geopyopia. Therefore, Fashros must venture past the western horizon and into the great unknown."
