 yomtanian.2.d:0 "The Empire of Moxon has been shattered, and with it their Yomtanian armies are destroyed. However, the war has undeniably devestated our land. It is time to settle down and recover before we make another move."
 yomtanian.2.a:0 "Let us heal."

 oppia.2.t:0 "The Discovery of Kotzbal"
 oppia.2.d:0 "Umzatian explorers have discovered the distant island of Kotzbal. They say it is uninhabited and open for Umzatian settlement. Perhaps it is time to expand our influence outside of the mainland. After all, we have always been a navigatory people."
 oppia.2.a:0 "This is a worthwhile endeavor!"
 oppia.2.b:0 "We have more important things at hand."

 oppia.15.t:0 "The Western Frontier"
 oppia.15.d:0 "Explorers come with good news! The lightly settled lands west of the border are rich in resources and open for Oppian pioneers to colonize. Exotic commodities, such as dyes and spice, exist in abundance. They call these lands 'Asetli', the land of bounty. We would be fools not to sponsor a campaign to settle there permanently, they say. It would be a risky venture, but if the rumors are true, it could be a great asset to our growing nation."
 oppia.15.a:0 "These lands will be ours!"
 oppia.15.b:0 "This sounds dangerous."
 oppia.16.t:0 "A Strategic City"
 oppia.16.d:0 "The colonization of Asetli has been an astounding success. New cities have been constructed by our brave pioneers, creating new economic activity and trade routes in the region. Artisans, farmers and merchants alike now call Asetli home. But perhaps, Asetli could use a new addition. Some explorers have pointed out the strategic importance of the Cape of Vinkim, and call for a new city to be built there. If we were to seize control of it, we would have complete control of all trade coming in and out of the Gomic Sea. Such a move might upset other powers, but it would also grant us even more leverage in trade than we do even now."
 oppia.16.a:0 "It will serve us well."
 oppia.16.b:0 "We don't need this."

 gaxal.1.d:0 "Our province of Ameleka gives us little, our financial advisor tells us. It is only a distraction to try to assert control over another island when we can barely hold on to Lerush. Therefore, our advisor tells us, it would be wise to sell our possessions on Ameleka to Xofka, in exchange for 100 ducats. Perhaps, he is right."
 gaxal.1.a:0 "Let them have it."
 gaxal.1.b:0 "Preposterous!"

 gaxal.2.t:0 "The Purchase of West Ameleka"

Many of them have adopted the Bamali faith, presenting even more problems for us. Apart from the recent construction of the city of Jimkalin, we have struggled to put much of our steppe land to good use, and have a hard time controlling our people.

Diplomats from Agixiana continually pester us about it, and it would not be a surprise to see the armies of Agixion seize the provinces at any moment. Therefore, it might be best to simply sell the land to the Agixianans in exchange for 300 ducats."

 pextodis.4.b:0 "Preposterous!"

 pextodis.5.t:0 "Estate Conflict"
 pextodis.5.d:0 "Our subjects are fighting each other! The nobility and clergy have come into conflict over land rights, with many different individual claims overlapping.

 pextodis.6.d:0 "A local clash between the army and Glazian dissenters has spiralled out of control into something much more. Many soldiers are dead, and several villages in southern Glazia were burned to the ground out of revenge. This has the risk of disillusion the Glazians from the idea of a unified Pextoglazia. We may have to make some painful concessions, or this could become a major, long-term conflict."
 pextodis.6.a:0 "Apologize profusely."
 pextodis.6.b:0 "Crack down even more."

 pextodis.7.t:0 "Minorities Demand Rights"
 pextodis.7.d:0 "Many minority groups on the fringes of our country are asking for cultural autonomy. While this could help keep Pextoglazia intact, it would a huge blow to our economy. Things are not so bad that not handing out these rights would cause revolt... yet, anyway. If we do not give them something, it is possible that they could try to break away in the future."
 pextodis.7.a:0 "... Fine."
 pextodis.7.b:0 "In their dreams."

 pextodis.8.t:0 "Corruption Scandal"
 pextodis.8.d:0 "It has been revealed that someone in the upper echelons of government has been embezzling funds. We simply do not know who is responsible, but we can certainly narrow it down. Issuing a general purge could help root out some of the state's internal rot, but could also cause us a great deal of inconvenience."

 pextodis.8.c:0 "It is not our concern."

 pextodis.9.t:0 "Banditry Problems"
 pextodis.9.d:0 "Bandits roam the Pextan countryside! One can hardly travel outside of the cities without being robbed of every possession. This is making it difficult for internal trade to function properly, and our inaction on this front is certainly not helping the battle for people's hearts and minds. It is possible for us to solve this problem, but it would be very expensive."

 pextodis.10.t:0 "Diocese Demands"
 pextodis.10.d:0 "Our supposedly loyal Bishops have come to us with what they call an offer, but what we know as extortion. They want less responsibilities, more local freedoms and a lesser tax burden. They are using our moment of weakness to their own advantage. With massive leverage over us, saying no would be difficult. However, signing this deal would also be a humiliating blow to the idea of Pextoglazian unity."
 pextodis.10.a:0 "What choice do we have?"
 pextodis.10.b:0 "Imbeciles!"

 pextodis.11.t:0 "Cowardice"
 pextodis.11.d:0 "The army is facing a massive problem, no one wants to fight. Recruiters are struggling to fill regiments, as many potential recruits, and even those who are already soldiers, simply run away at the slightest suggestion that they will have to fight. No one wants to face battle, and we are having a hard time manning the army as a result. This could be potentially disastrous, as it leaves us vulnerable to attack."

 pextodis.11.b:0 "We will tolerate this, for now."

 pextodis.12.t:0 "Trouble Brewing"
 pextodis.12.d:0 "Trouble is brewing in Pextoglazia. Falling confidence in the central government, as well as increasing friction between the different elements of Pextoglazian society are causing unrest and preventing us from governing effectively.

 lathvy_piety.12.d:0 "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [Root.GovernmentName], in many ways these are small communities within the community, with their own rules, customs and even laws. It is also common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, and often unorthodox adaption of the Romal's teachings. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the clergy to penetrate the urban milieu. An artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs.

 vanoma.5.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had an idea. While Vanoma is a very advanced and prosperous nation, it lacks knowledge of the outside world. The Vanomans are aware of the existence of a great civilization straddling the shorelines of a vast inland sea, somewhere far in the south. A nation known as Moxon once contacted them to use their technology in a war against pale, monstruous beasts. Those same beasts then attacked Vanoma some decades later! To avoid such situations in the future, it would be very useful to know what is happening in the south. Therefore, an expedition should be sent to travel, map out and document the various countries of the region. It would be an expensive endeavor, however, and Vanoma is not the most outgoing nation."

The cities of Ximal, Sixan, Agixion and especially Xon strike awe into the delegation members. Xon in particular is an incredible feat of architecture. It is not just the cities that impress, however, but also the local technology. Many unique inventions, some of which are completely new to us, prove that Vanoma is not the only inventive society.

 vanoma.9.desc:0 "The expedition continues, this time by sea instead of land. On the other side of the Gomic from Ga Xal, in western Estal, lies the Holy Kingdom of Pextoglazia. The Lathvy religion, which we have known about for a long time thanks to Stroktur and Kapolia, seems to have originated in the Pextoglazian capital city of Pomlen. We have visited the Pextoglazian High Priest, and he taught us many interesting, but heretical, lessons.

 vanoma.12.t:0 "The Expedition Has Been Lost!"
 vanoma.12.desc:0 "Tragically, it seems like the expedition to the Gomic has failed. There has been no sign of them for a long time, so it is safe to assume they didn't make it.

 umzatia.1.d:0 "The Umzatians have destroyed The Crown Kingdom, even Quanex decided to secede taking the Crown of Emintas with them. If we entered and occupied the border areas of Kistu and Emasan, no one would be able to stop us." 
 umzatia.1.a:0 "This is a great opportunity to strenghten our state."

 umzatia.3.b:0 "Let's not get involved."
 
 umzatia.4.t:0 "The Quanexite Deluge"
 umzatia.4.d:0 "Today the flood barriers of Quanex burst for seemingly no reason, flooding the harbour districts and lower parts of the palace. Unfortunately, that is where our dear King was staying. His excellency drowned among the havoc, first hit by a falling column. Meanwhile some state secrets were leaked to the people, and that is why we think that all this was orchestrated by enemies of the government or even the whole Crown Kingdom. It should come as no surprise that our lands have plunged into chaos the likes of which they have not seen since the end of the war with the Moxon. Umzatians seeing the state of our realm decided to march into Imagua in a what they call a peacekeeping mission, whether they will leave voluntarily is uncertain."
 umzatia.4.a:0 "The Gods have left us!"
 
 umzatia.5.t:0 "A Warning"
 umzatia.5.d:0 "If Umzatia gains any advantage in this war, they will be able to force us to accept a peace deal that might mean the end of our rule in Oppia."
 umzatia.5.a:0 "Quanex will not fall."
 
 umzatia.6.t:0 "The Peace Deal"
 umzatia.6.d:0 "idk" 
 umzatia.6.a:0 "fail"
 
 #Oppian events
 oppia.13.t:0 "The Question of Imogua"
 oppia.13.d:0 "The chaos in our realm has died down, but it seems that Umzatia doesn't want to return Imogua to it's rightful owners."
 oppia.13.a:0 "Demand that they cede Imogua to us. The bastards were propably behind all this!"
 oppia.13.b:0 "They can have it."
 
 oppia.14.t:0 "Crown Kingdom's Delegation"
 oppia.14.d:0 "A group of diplomats arrived in our capital, demanding that we "return the rightful Crown Kingdom lands of Imogua which we stole". This claim is clearly false and a product of the corrupt Quanexite elite, but perhaps we should agree and avoid angering them. 
 oppia.14.a:0 "Imogua was obtained legitimately. We should keep it."
 oppia.14.b:0 "They can have it."
 
 #Estal Flavor
 estal.1.t:0 "Yomtanian Raid"
 estal.1.d:0 "A band of Yomtanians wandered unnoticed into the area of one of our settlements and attacked it, burning houses and eating people along with animals. Some were kidnapped, but we don't know if they can be called lucky. The few inhabitants that are left ask for our help to restore order and rebuild."
 estal.1.a:0 "Organise help."
 estal.1.b:0 "They will have to deal with it themselves."

 estal.2.t:0 "The Lathvy Faith"
 estal.2.d:0 "Lathvy missionairies have arrived in $CAPITAL_CITY$ to tell us of the Lathvy faith. The world is a battle between good and evil, Ara and Loys, and we must help them in their quest to save Famana. Many in our court, and indeed the rest of the country, have become infatuated with this new faith. Perhaps, we should declare it our state religion?"
 estal.2.a:0 "We will serve Ara."
 estal.2.b:0 "Exile the missionairies!"

 estal.3.t:0 "A Great Humiliation"
 estal.3.d:0 "We have been defeated by those who we should have easily been able to defeat. We have never known shame like this. In accordance with Gotzlic customs, it is only appropriate that we retreat from Gotzlica, since our enemies are clearly superior. Maybe we can find new opportunities in the steppes of Central Estal."
 estal.3.a:0 "The shame is too great to stay in Gotzlica."
 estal.3.b:0 "No, this is but a mere setback."

 jasuaE.9.t:0 "Betrayal from Nakoa"
 jasuaE.9.d:0 "As the Fashran menace, allied with the forces of the Great Monster, approaches our borders, our supposed 'allies' in Nakoa have completely betrayed us! They have abandoned our courts and refused to provide military aid. We shall face this threat alone."

 jasuaE.17.t:0 "The Bilik Migration"
 jasuaE.17.d:0 "Biliku has fallen. Foreign barbarians have conquered and pillaged our home, leaving us no choice but to flee from our country. Many Biliks have made the long march from Biliku, to Bamfad, and all the way through Aresia. We do not know if we are safe from the Great Monster here, but we have not found a better place to settle. The migration has left what remains of the Bilik state weak and ineffective, and it will take years before we have restored any semblance of our former strength."
 jasuaE.17.a:0 "At least we are free..."

 #Fashran events
 
 fashros.1.t:0 "Westward Expansion"
 fashros.1.d:0 "The horde grows restless without war. To search for new riches to plunder, we must look to the west. Geopyopia has repelled all our attacks, so we have no choice but to look elsewhere."
 fashros.1.a:0 "Fashros will grow larger!"

 fashros.2.t:0 "Fate of Nozumol"
 fashros.2.d:0 "Nozumol is no longer washoomist. Having converted all of them to the true faith, this raises the question of what to do about their culture. We could try to integrate them into the Ravsho cultural sphere and turn them into us. But perhaps it would be more beneficial to let them preserve their own local quirks and customs?"
 fashros.2.a:0 "Let them all be Ravsho."
 fashros.2.b:0 "They deserve a place in the Tonxara."

 fashros.3.t:0 "Pushing the Frontier"
 fashros.3.d:0 "We have conquered Nozumol. Beyond it, all we can see is a vast, unending sea of grass. What lies to the west is not known, but we will soon find out."
 fashros.3.a:0 "Fashros will grow larger!"

 fashros.4.t:0 "Discovery of Biliku"
 fashros.4.d:0 "Fashran scouts have made a fantastic discovery to the west of Nozumol! We have found an entire civilization, lightly defended and almost as rich as the Geopyopians of the east. We have found what we have desired for decades, a new route for expansion."
 fashros.4.a:0 "Fashros will grow larger!"

 fashros.5.t:0 "The Vanoman Question"
 fashros.5.d:0 "The Vanomans, as they call themselves, have established a colony in coastal Nheomyr. The city of Emtik seems to be a rich one, with large paper mills. Paper is a material we are incapable of producing ourselves, but could be very useful. Many chiefs call for us to attack Vanoma and seize their colony for this very reason, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is considering another idea. The Vanomans are significantly more technologically advanced than us, which raises the question of whether or not we should really be messing with them. Perhaps a better approach would be to make them an offer and spare their colony in exchange for some of their technology. Whichever solution is settled upon, something must be done about the Vanoman Question."
 fashros.5.a:0 "Seize the colony."
 fashros.5.b:0 "Make them an offer they can't refuse."

 vanoma.2.t:0 "The Offer"
 vanoma.2.d:0 "'Diplomats' from the distant Fashran Tonxara have arrived in the port of Montava, and they seek an audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They come with an offer, or threat rather, regarding an invasion of our Emtik colony. If we do not comply with their demands of giving them technology, they will take our colony from us. But, if we choose to help them, they will let our colony be and establish an alliance with us. If we accepted this, it would be profoundly embarassing, but the option of war with the Fashran hordes seems like an even less appealing option."
 vanoma.2.a:0 "Do we really have a choice?"
 vanoma.2.b:0 "We won't give up what's ours!"

 fashros.6.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 fashros.6.d:0 "Our empire no longer consists of just the regions surrounding Anmoea. Many chiefs wish for a new seat of power, more central and closer to the western frontier. Anmoea is a fine location, but other places such as Tyma offer some great advantages."
 fashros.6.a:0 "Anmoea has served us well."
 fashros.6.b:0 "Tyma is our best option."
 fashros.6.c:0 "Kinvirel will make a fine capital."

 fashros.7.t:0 "Securing the Milk Road"
 fashros.7.d:0 "The Milk Road, walked by desert barbarians and Geopyopian merchants, is a vital part of the local trade network in northern Antebar. Control of it would constitute a great source of revenue for the Tonxara, so it would be a no-brainer to extend our borders into the desert if it provided us with increased control of the Milk Road. However, this would involve the eviction of the local tribes, which may require brute force."
 fashros.7.a:0 "Fashros will grow larger!"

 fashros.8.t:0 "Fate of the Emtiks"
 fashros.8.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was visited by a small group of Vanoman settlers who, claiming to represent all Emtik people, begged to respect their customs and place of residence. In return, they offer to teach the famous Vanoman technological knowledge to anyone who wishes and to assist Fashros in making new discoveries."
 fashros.8.a:0 "If they promise to be loyal..."
 fashros.8.b:0 "The horde doesn't make exceptions."

 fashros.11.t:0 "The Fall of Nozumol"
 fashros.11.d:0 "With the capital of Nozumol under our control, the remaining forces of Nozumol had deemed their struggle worthless and had decided to surrended themselves to the Tonxara. "
 fashros.11.a:0 "Good riddance."

 fashros.14.t:0 "Winds From the East"
 fashros.14.d:0 "Reports have come to us from traders of distant lands being roamed by a jingoistic, religious, nomadic empire. These people are apparently brutal, and seek to flatten everything in their wake. They tell us to take this warning seriously."
 fashros.14.a:0 "From the steppes, hm?"
 fashros_discovery:0 "The Fashran Tonxara will continue to edge closer and closer to the Gomic."

 fashros.15.t:0 "Future of the Tonxara"
 fashros.15.d:0 "We have been successful in spreading our religion, crushing infidels and taking over the Gomic. Yet, as we look to the future, things are more grim. Our nation is getting too big to handle, and has already been split into sub-Tonxaras. The question is now not if Fashros will collapse, but rather when."
 fashros.15.a:0 "We are running out of time."
 fashros_death:0 "By our best estimates, a united Tonxara will only survive for 25 more years."

 fashros.16.t:0 "The End of the Tonxara."
 fashros.16.d:0 "The Crota'tam of the Tonxara has suddenly died of unknown causes. Whats more, he has left each separate Tonxara within the greater Fashran Tonxara to each of his sons. This has caused the Empire to split apart into separate domains. Albeit it still functions as one, disunity is beginning to creep in."
 fashros_death:0 "By our best estimates, a united Tonxara will only survive for 25 more years."
 fashros.16.a:0 "Is this really the end?"

 fashros.17.t:0 "Collapse of the Crowns."
 fashros.17.d:0 "Today, the system holding the different Tonxaras has collapsed. Each Tonxara has now went its own route. Fashros and the old Tonxara is no more."

 fashros.18.t:0 "Nakoa Collapsed!"
 fashros.18.d:0 "By taking the key cities of Arrol and Ayli, the Nakoan Government has been unsuccessful at contacting the feudal lords residing in the Northern Mountains. They have declared independence, and weakened our enemy."
 fashros.18.a:0 "The Horde will devour all of them."
 nakoa_collapsed:0 "A few nations in the North of Nakoa shall become independent."

 fashros.19.t:0 "Yabonia Fractures!"
 fashros.19.d:0 "By seizing the key city of Jimkalin, the Yabonian government has been unsuccessful at contacting regional governments in the south. These have now declared independence, crippling the central government of Yabonia."
 fashros.19.a:0 "The Horde will devour them all."
 yabonia_collapsed:0 "A few nations in the southern Yabonia will become independent."

 fasros.20.t:0 "Into Jasua!"

 fashros.21.a:0 "Into Ga Xal!"

 fashros.23.t:0 "The Horde Arrives!"
 fashros.23.d:0 "Refugees come with horrific news. Foreign barbarians have entered Delkia! It is said that they pillage everything they come across, leaving few survivors. The day we have dreaded for years is now here; Fashros has arrived."
 fashros.23.a:0 "We're next!"

 fashros.24.t:0 "Fracturing of the Tribes"
 fashros.24.d:0 "The tribal structures that have held the Ravsho people together for centuries are breaking down. To our horror, this is causing the local ruling elites of our empire to split off from the tribal confederation of Fashros to form their own identities. This, in combination with the other problems in our empire, could very well mean the end of the Tonxara. Let us hope it never comes to pass."
 fashros.24.a:0 "This does not bode well."

 fashros.31.t:0 "The Fashran Tonxara"
 fashros.31.d:0 "Fashros is a confederation of nomadic tribes, recently unified under one, greater empire. To ensure victory, loot and cohesion, Fashros must journey into unknown lands in the west."
 fashros.31.a:0 "The horde is coming."

 fashros.32.t:0 "The Aresian Resistance"
 fashros.32.d:0 "The Aresians are resisting our rule! They evidently do not want to be converted to the true faith. Organized resistance is popping up all over Aresia, and our spies tell us that Aresian churches remain open in secret. Converting these people will be a struggle."
 fashros.32.a:0 "They think they can fight us?"

 fashros.33.t:0 "The Vanoman Resistance"
 fashros.33.d:0 "The Vanomans, just like the Aresians, are resisting conversion to the true faith. We are at a loss of what to do about this. Perhaps we will just have to let them remain heathens. While converting them would be optimal, it may not be in the cards at the moment."
 fashros.33.a:0 "They will bend eventually..."

 tonxara.1.t:0 "The Nhoma Tonxara"
 tonxara.1.d:0 "The eastern core of the Fashran Empire has been inherited by the Nhoma Tonxara. This state is mostly made of steppes and many Tonmo clans who were previously united under one Tonxara. Now that the unified Tonmo state is gone, there is no doubt that the Nhoma Tonxara will have to face severe hardships as it struggles to control the roaming hordes."
 tonxara.1.a:0 "We'll see what the future holds."

 tonxara.2.t:0 "The Kisholi Tonxara"
 tonxara.2.d:0 "Considered the most prestigous of the Tonxaras, Kisholi is in an advantageous spot as the most civilised nation in the Tonmo world, and with a stable power structure. Jimkalin, the capital, has become one of the most important Tonmo cities. Despite this, there is also significant corruption within the state, and it will have to contend with new rising powers."
 tonxara.2.a:0 "We'll see what the future holds."

 tonxara.3.t:0 "The Jafxoi Tonxara"
 tonxara.3.d:0 "The furthest Tonxara away from the Tonmo heartland, Jafxoi is in a precarious position. For one, much of its population isnt as well integrated into Tonmo culture as in Kisholi or Nhoma. It also faces challenges from external powers. However, if Jafxoi can overcome these issues, it can easily dominate the Gomic."
 tonxara.3.a:0 "We'll see what the future holds."

 tonxara.4.t:0 "The Hoyros Tonxara"
 tonxara.4.d:0 "Hoyros is in a vulnerable place compared to the other Tonxaras. Sandwitched between Washoomists and rival Tonxaras, and its forces thinly spread out across mountains, it will likely struggle to survive across the coming years."
 tonxara.4.a:0 "We'll see what the future holds."

 tonxara.7.t:0 "The Secession of Koff"
 tonxara.7.d:0 "The traitorous state of Koff has seceded from our country. This is of course highly treasonous, but as a new and unstable state, it is unclear if it would even be worth fighting them. Such a move would only destabilize our nation further, so it may be more advantageous to simply let them have their independence for now."
 tonxara.7.a:0 "Let them go."
 tonxara.7.b:0 "Koff belongs to us!"

 yomtanian.1.t:0 "Allow historical Yomtanian invasions?"

 jasuaE.10.d:0 "Before the arrival of the Bohoran invaders, the largest Kachik tribe used to be the Kalargans. Although they put up a fight, they were eventually pushed back to the North. Now, as a the new Kachik state has seized Bohora, we may proclaim a return to our roots."
 jasuaE.10.a:0 "This is the end for the invaders!"

 bosisi.2.t:0 "The Alu revolt"
 bosisi.2.d:0 "The Alu region has always been problematic for us. Unlike the rest of Kurkar, it is very well settled and civilised, and is never keen to work with the central government. This has culminated in a mass uprising led by the Duke of Alu demanding independence. Already, many of his allies have come fled across the Lake to found their own state."
 bosisi.2.a:0 "This is too much of a headache."
 bosisi.2.b:0 "Death to traitors!"

 eastereggs.1.t:0 "The discovery of Proto-Gomic"
 eastereggs.1.d:0 "Linguists from New Pexamol have discovered undeniable evidence that most Gomic languages, from Oppian to the Xalian languages to Jasuan and Makyan all have a common ancestor, thought to have existed many hundreds of years ago. Over time, due to natural linguistic changes similar to those we have observed in Ancient Xalnish, this Proto-Gomic language split apart into many different groups."
 eastereggs.1.a:0 "New Pexamol will be famous for this discovery!"

 eastereggs.2.t:0 "A 'Comet' crashes in our land"
 eastereggs.2.d:0 "Last night, a spectacular sight was seen in the skies of [Root.GetName]. Our astronomers saw hundreds of moving dots, brighter than even the Planets, whizzing around the sky at unfathomable speeds. These were not meteors, their patterns were too unpredictable. With closer inspection, some of them appeared to exhibit an oblong shape. During the course of the night, some of these dots seemed to shatter into many pieces. Then, one began glowing red and growing in size as it straked across our sky.\n\nThis morning, inhabitants of a village have proclaimed that the object seen flying through the sky yesterday landed in one of their fields. It had caused a loud bang and burnt many of their crops. The object is nothing like we've seen before, long and slender, made of some transcendant materials but charred black, and full of metal ropes. Inside the object, there are rooms and hallways, filled with dead Yomtanians. The people of our nation believe that we have discovered a comet that has fallen to the Earth, meaning extremely bad luck unless we dissasemble it to rid the evil presence."
 eastereggs.2.a:0 "I don't think that's a comet."

At first it was a local event, but word spread and now people from all over the Gomic come to the island to take part in what has been given the name 'Sawcon'. The influx of people has brought new ideas and even those who do not participate in the tournament learn a lot. Moreover, several masterpieces have already been created at Sawcon, some of which have even found their way into the palaces of kings and city councils."

 eastereggs.4.t:0 "Oforog's insanity"
 eastereggs.4.d:0 "When the previous Emperor of Moxon died suddenly of unknown causes, likely possesion by Loys' spirit, his realm was left to his eldest son Oforog. However, he was not qualified to rule at all, which had led to the splintering of the Maxan isles. He had likely inherited the same genetic condition from his father which caused paranoia and made him eternally possesed by evil spirits. Agixiana's future is completely undecided as we have only now realised that a mad king rules our nation."

Despite this, the secular Lord that is ruling over the province has chased out our Priest, and claimed the province for Nevia. Whether he is acting alone, we cannot tell, although we must act on this before the annexation is legitimised."
 pexto.20.a:0 "Find him! Arrest that man, bring him to trial!"
 pexto.20.b:0 "It's only one province."

 pexto.21.t:0 "Lasdy defects!"
 pexto.21.d:0 "For a long time, the province of Lasdy has been a major issue for us. It is across the border in Pixrol, yet culturally it is closer to us. Luckily, this issue has been resolved as the Lord who rules over the province has defected to our nation. The Pixrolians have shown their weakness by refusing to act on this rebellion, and the province is now in our hands."
 pexto.21.a:0 "Perfect."

 pexto.22.t:0 "Pixrol and our claim on Lasdy"
 pexto.22.d:0 "For a long time, the province of Lasdy has been a major issue for us. It is across the border in Pixrol, yet culturally it is closer to us. Recently, the local Lord of Lasdy has tried to rebel, and flip over to our side. The Lord has been arrested and is being brought to the High Court, although this is the perfect time to present our case as to why we should own this province."
 pexto.22.a:0 "Let's see what the Holy King thinks."

 pexto.23.t:0 "The issue of Lasdy"
 pexto.23.d:0 "In the North of our country, the province of Lasdy has been of major contention. Both Pixrol and Nevia lay claim to the territory, but by official boundaries the province is to belong to the Diocese of Pixrol. The local Lord has however ran wild, expelling the Priest and trying to oveturn the province over to the other side. The Bishop of Pixrol has personally delivered him to our custody, although a congregation from Nevia has also arrived to argue their case as to whether the province should belong to them or Pixrol."
 pexto.23.a:0 "Let's solve this with a Trial by Ordeal."
 pexto.23.b:0 "It is clearly Nevia's by right."
 pexto.23.c:0 "The old decrees clearly say it belongs to Pixrol."
 pexto.23.d:0 "Uhh... I don't know. Let them fight it out among themselves."

 pexto.24.t:0 "The [PEX.Monarch.GetTitle] authorises our claim!"
 pexto.24.d:0 "We have been blessed! The Court has ruled that the province of Lasdy is now officially ours to keep."
 pexto.24.a:0 "I knew we were in the right."

 pexto.25.t:0 "The [PEX.Monarch.GetTitle] disputes our claim!"
 pexto.25.d:0 "After reviewing both nation's claims to Lasdy, it has been officially established that the province, for the time being, should not belong to us. The other party controls it now."
 pexto.25.a:0 "Damn."

 pexto.26.t:0 "The [PEX.Monarch.GetTitle] refuses to take a side!"
 pexto.26.d:0 "After much debate, it is clear that the Holy Court is not interested in the matter. They have shrugged it off, and suggested we resolve it ourselves."
 pexto.26.a:0 "They... huh? What?"

 pexto.27.t:0 "The High Priest proposes Trial by Ordeal"
 pexto.27.d:0 "After much debate, the Court has agreed that the only way to resolve the matter is to ask Ara directly. The High Priest himself will carry out a procedure where both Priests are given a piece of dry bread, and then eat it while simultaneously praying. The incorrect party will choke on the bread, leaving the other Bishop with the province, as proven by Ara."
 pexto.27.a:0 "You take the bread."

 pexto.28.t:0 "[PPX.Monarch.GetTitle] [PPX.Monarch.GetName] chokes on the bread!"
 pexto.28.d:0 "The Trial by Ordeal works by having each Bishop take a piece of dry bread, and then recite a prayer without choking. Should one choke, they are deemed guilty by Ara himself. In this case, the Bishop of Pixrol choked on the bread first. As a result, Nevia has won the case and claims Lasdy for themselves."
 pexto.28.a:0 "The province is Nevia's."

 pexto.29.t:0 "[PNV.Monarch.GetTitle] [PNV.Monarch.GetName] chokes on the bread!"
 pexto.29.d:0 "The Trial by Ordeal works by having each Bishop take a piece of dry bread, and then recite a prayer without choking. Should one choke, they are deemed guilty by Ara himself. In this case, the Bishop of Nevia choked on the bread first. As a result, Pixrol has won the case and claims Lasdy for themselves."
 pexto.29.a:0 "The province is Pixrol's."

 pexto.30.t:0 "We win the trial by Sacrament!"
 pexto.30.d:0 "Miracilously, our opponent choked on the holy bread, and we have thus come out victorious in the case! Ara has clearly shown His support for us!"
 pexto.30.a:0 "A miracle!"

 pexto.31.t:0 "We lose the trial by Sacrament"
 pexto.31.d:0 "Despite the best attempts of our Bishop, he was unable to stop himself from being the first to choke on the Holy Bread. Resultingly, we have lost the trial, and the province has been ceded to our opponent."
 pexto.31.a:0 "Ara knows what's best."
 pexto.31.b:0 "That whole thing was clearly rigged."

 pexto.32.t:0 "The Walara Proposal"
 pexto.32.d:0 "The Walarans have long developed their own culture, free from Pomlen. With the recent independence of both Pixrol and Jinasa, we have come to propose a union between the two kingdoms, with one common king being crowned the title 'King of Walara'."
 pexto.32.a:0 "Let's go ahead."
 pexto.32.b:0 "Ehhh... No."

 pexto.33.t:0 "The Walara Proposal"
 pexto.33.d:0 "Our neighbour Pixrol has sent us a most intruiging proposal. They propose that we merge our two nations into one crown, known collectively as Walara. Of course, the King of Pixrol has arrogantly suggested that he should be the first King, but we cannot rule out this possibility, as it might defend us from Ordica."
 pexto.33.a:0 "Deal."
 pexto.33.b:0 "If they want our land, they should take it with blood."

 pexto.34.t:0 "The Formation of Walara"
 pexto.34.d:0 "Now that the Walarans are free, we can rightfully crown ourselves the King of Walara - however there are issues. For one, the Bishop of Pixrol is furious with the proposal, and instead proposes a more Holy religion-driven state, led by himself, the newly proclaimed High Priest of Vapalim. On the other hand, many of our feudal subjects would rather reduce the amount of religious influence, harking back to the days of the Dioceses, and propose an autocratic system instead."
 pexto.34.a:0 "Theocracy."
 pexto.34.b:0 "Monarchy."
 pexto.34.c:0 "Why not both?"

 pexto.35.t:0 "Jinasa rejects our proposal."
 pexto.35.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, our diplomats have been unsuccessful in convincing Jinasa to diplomatically join a united realm."
 pexto.35.a:0 "Damn."

 pexto.36.t:0 "The High Priest of Vapalim"
 pexto.36.d:0 "Vapalim has historically been called the 'Pomlen of the East'. Located on the Slapni sea, it has been the historical site of the Bishop of Pixrol, one of the more important Bishops in the country. After the creation of Walara, the theocracy has decided to elevate the rank of the Bishop of Pixrol into a High Priest to rival Pomlen. Many are seeing this as the start of the fall of Pextoglazia's former influence."
 pexto.36.a:0 "So they claim to be different..."

 ordica.4.t:0 "The Legacy of Pextoglazia"
 ordica.4.d:0 "Following the collapse of Pextoglazia, opinions have been mixed within the Lathvy world on how to follow on. The High Priest of Pomlen has been disputed by many, now that his power is frequently challenged. In particular, today many Bishops and Priests met in Celzion. The Council of Celzion, as it is now known, has officially written up a new list of Lathvy doctrines separate from the High Priest. These involve the decentralisation of the faith into a council of Bishops who make decisions collectively, and questioning of some old Pextoglazian policies."
 ordica.4.a:0 "The dawn of a new era."

 ordica.5.t:0 "The Legacy of Pextoglazia"
 ordica.5.d:0 "Following the Council of Celzion, we now have the choice to switch away from our old doctrines regarding our faith."

This resulted in him storming the Palace walls using an army of what appeared to be Yomtanians, Although Kalargan forces routed the attack, we must be wary of another attack as it could be disastrous, and maybe consider giving in."

Many local lords and tribes want to break off from us, not recognising our authority ever since the collapse of Fashros. We must convince them with the might of steel that we are worthy."
 tonxara.6.a:0 "The coming years look grim."

 nhl.1.d:0 "A hidden conspiracy has unfolded over a period of years. Government officials have worked with parts of the Nahallaian army to undermine the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and replace him with a new leader. Today, the coup began. An attempt on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s life has left him scarred and deformed. The very existence of the Nahallaian state is now under threat, as the coup leaves the country vulnerable to attacks from tribes, the Tolans or even Ordica itself."
 nhl.1.a:0 "Kill the traitors!"

 nhl.2.t:0 "The Nahallaian Deluge"
 nhl.2.d:0 "Nahallaia is in chaos. As two rival [NHL.Monarch.GetTitle]s fight for control of the nation, they give us an opportunity to restore the great nation of Tolo. If we enter Nahallaia with our troops and support the new pretender to the throne, we can destroy the Nahallaian state forever. Western Ordica will return to how it was meant to be, ruled by one, benevolent Tolan Kingdom."
 nhl.2.a:0 "Let us help them!"
 nhl.2.b:0 "It's too risky."

 nhl.3.t:0 "Victory in Nahallaia"

 nhl.4.t:0 "The End of the Nahallaian Empire"

 nhl.4.a:0 "We have lost."

 nhl.5.t:0 "Tolo Defeated"
 nhl.5.d:0 "Against all odds, we have held our empire together. Alo Tramo has been defeated, as have the pretenders to our throne. Nahallaia remains the supreme ruler of Western Ordica. Now, to ensure this never happens again, we must assimilate the Tolans into our culture."
