 nhm_dynastic_desc:0 "Nhoma was infamous for being a rowdy and unstable place, where many dynasties and tribes fought for power. We must bring these various factions together under one crown."

 nhm_great_desc:0 "We have inherited the cities of Tyma, Anmoea, Bizugu and Dimdivu. These cities have long been major sites of trade and often act as oases in the harsh grasslands of Nhoma."
 nhm_wars_desc:0 "On our southern border exists the powerful but slowing weakening Natiu dynasty. This state has fallen far since its glory days, but still poses a major threat to us. We must launch an offensive to weaken Geopyopia before they attack us!"
 nhm_island_desc:0 "To our east sits an unknown landmass that appears quite large. This place is known by its natives as Bhilis. Perhaps we should send an expedition to learn more."
 nhm_shipyards_desc:0 "The great shipyards of Runtatoj were always underitilized by Fashros, but its location is too perfect for us not to make it our staple port. A great eastern navy to rival that of Geopyopia will rise!"
