 oppia.1.d:0 "The Empire of Moxon has been shattered, and with it their Yomtanian armies are destroyed. However, the war has undeniably devestated our land. It is time to settle down and recover before we make another move."
 oppia.1.a:0 "Let us heal."

 oppia.2.t:0 "The Discovery of Kotzbal"
 oppia.2.d:0 "Umzatian explorers have discovered the distant island of Kotzbal. They say it is uninhabited and open for Umzatian settlement. Perhaps it is time to expand our influence outside of the mainland. After all, we have always been a navigatory people."
 oppia.2.a:0 "This is a worthwhile endeavor!"
 oppia.2.b:0 "We have more important things at hand."

 oppia.15.t:0 "The Western Frontier"
 oppia.15.d:0 "Explorers come with good news! The lightly settled lands west of the border are rich in resources and open for Oppian pioneers to colonize. Exotic commodities, such as dyes and spice, exist in abundance. They call these lands 'Asetli', the land of bounty. We would be fools not to sponsor a campaign to settle there permanently, they say. It would be a risky venture, but if the rumors are true, it could be a great asset to our growing nation."
 oppia.15.a:0 "These lands will be ours!"
 oppia.15.b:0 "This sounds dangerous."
 oppia.16.t:0 "A Strategic City"
 oppia.16.d:0 "The colonization of Asetli has been an astounding success. New cities have been constructed by our brave pioneers, creating new economic activity and trade routes in the region. Artisans, farmers and merchants alike now call Asetli home. But perhaps, Asetli could use a new addition. Some explorers have pointed out the strategic importance of the Cape of Vinkim, and call for a new city to be built there. If we were to seize control of it, we would have complete control of all trade coming in and out of the Gomic Sea. Such a move might upset other powers, but it would also grant us even more leverage in trade than we do even now."
 oppia.16.a:0 "It will serve us well."

Therefore, our advisor tells us, it would be wise to sell our possessions on Ameleka to Xofka, in exchange for 100 ducats. Perhaps, he is right."

It is also common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, and often unorthodox adaption of the Romal's teachings. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the clergy to penetrate the urban milieu. An artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs.

It is famous for inventing the Hamburger, and although it would remain for centuries as one restaurant, it would eventually expand by the modern era into a global brand. Whappers would become an icon of Jimkalin, and millions of tourists would pour into the palace-sized institution to enjoy fine dining."

 restema.1.d:0 "Our priests call out for the centuries long practice of slavery to end in Restema. They claim that it stands in violation of lathvy morality and threaten to denounce the government over the issue. In addition, our adoption of Feniki culture has moved us closer to the Satryans and Oekbians, many of whom are still enslaved in parts of our country. The abolition of slavery would hurt the economy and upset local nobility, but could very well be the right decision long-term."

His excellency drowned among the havoc, first hit by a falling column. Meanwhile some state secrets were leaked to the people, and that is why we think that all this was orchestrated by enemies of the government or even the whole Crown Kingdom. It should come as no surprise that our lands have plunged into chaos the likes of which they have not seen since the end of the war with the Moxon. Umzatians seeing the state of our realm decided to march into Imagua in a what they call a peacekeeping mission, whether they will leave voluntarily is uncertain."
